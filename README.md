# Design
## Strategy Plane
Gamers Corner aims to provide users the ability to purchase games and track order history through a profile page

The objective of this project is to give the user an e-Commerce experience with a minimal profile for order tracking.

## Scope Plane
This project will look to provide an e-Commerce platform for purchasing games.

The website will convey the developers use of Python (mainly Django Framework), HTML, CSS and jQuery.

## Structure Plane
As the aim of the site is to provide an e-Commerce platform to the users the site was developed to be a linear multi-page site. The User has access to navigation in the top right of the home page and in a pop out menu on mobile.

## Skeleton Plane
From the structure above I was able to generate the below Wireframes for the site, while these wireframes are guidelines for building the main structure of the site the layout of the content is subject to change.
