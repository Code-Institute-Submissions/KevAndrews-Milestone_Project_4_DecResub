      "description": "Players once again take on the role of the Doom Slayer who battles the demonic forces of Hell from a first-person perspective. The game continues its predecessor\u0027s emphasis on push-forward combat encouraging the player to aggressively engage enemies in order to acquire health ammo and armor. The player has access to various firearms such as the Combat Shotgun Super Shotgun Heavy Cannon Rocket Launcher Plasma Rifle Chaingun BFG 9000 and Ballista. Melee weapons such as a chainsaw the Crucible Blade energy sword the Sentinel Argent Hammer and a retractable arm-blade called the Doomblade can also be used. The arm-blade provides the opportunity for a larger variety of quick and violent glory kill executions which drop extra health. The Super Shotgun is now equipped with the Meat Hook a ranged accessory which grabs on to enemies and slingshots the player towards them functioning as a grappling hook useful both in combat scenarios and environmental navigation. The Doom Slayer\u0027s armor now includes a shoulder-mounted Equipment Launcher with the ability to lob grenades and ice bombs. In addition there is the Flame Belch a flamethrower that sets enemies on fire with it to drop armor pickups. Finally killing enemies with the chainsaw will drop ammunition. New movement mechanics such as wall-climbing dash moves and horizontal bars to swing from have also been introduced. Like its predecessor Doom Eternal invites the player to develop simple tactics. As the game gets harder the player needs to use the advantages of fight arenas and their bonuses in more strategic ways. They also need to decide which enemy has to be killed first and how to move on the battlefield.",

Weapons picked up by the player have limited ammunition and break easily requiring the player to rely on defeating enemies to attain new weapons or making melee kills. Taking a single hit from an enemy bullet kills the player requiring them to restart the level. Though the game mechanics are typical of most shooters time only progresses normally when the player moves or fires a gun otherwise time is slowed; this is described in the game\u0027s tagline Time Moves Only When You Move. This gives the player the opportunity to alter their actions as to avoid the path of bullets or to better assess their current situation.",

      "description": "Hellblade: Senua\u0027s Sacrifice is divided in two types of gameplay: the first allows Senua to walk freely and interact with her surroundings. Those parts focus on either story via voiceover as Senua travels from one location to another or the resolution of a puzzle or challenge of some kind to progress further. She can use a capacity known as focus in reference to her tendency to see things differently from other people due to her condition to trigger puzzle-related events. If she uses her focus on totems hidden throughout the game it triggers a memory via voice-over of her friend Druth telling her of the stories of the Norsemen; activating all forty-four of them triggers a bonus cutscene shortly before the game\u0027s climax that extends on Druth\u0027s backstory. Several areas feature their own exclusive mechanics or trials such as reaching a safe zone in time before Senua dies or using the focus ability to modify the structure of her surroundings. In addition Hellblade features fights against malformed representations of Norsemen who block her progression including occasional bosses.",
